     capabilities, the switch allows for scalable multi-tenant network segmentation, enabling organizations
     to create isolated virtual networks across Layer 3 domains. Advanced Multicast Capabilities: It
     includes support for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP),
     and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for efficient handling of multicast traffic.

  4. **Programmability and Automation**: The N9K-C93108TC-FX3P can operate in Cisco NX-OS mode for traditional
     environments or in Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode for SDN and policy-driven
     networking, providing flexibility in deployment. The switch supports RESTful APIs, Python scripting,
     and Linux-based programmability, allowing network operators to automate and streamline network
     management tasks. Real-time telemetry provides deep visibility into network traffic and device health,
     enabling proactive monitoring and troubleshooting. This feature can be integrated with Cisco Nexus
     Dashboard Insights or third-party analytics tools.

     Ethernet (PoE) on 36 ports, providing enough power for devices such as IP phones, wireless access
     points, and IoT devices. The switch complies with the IEEE 802.3bt standard, allowing it to provide
     PoE++ capabilities, which are essential for high-power devices.

  6. **Security and Policy Management**: MACsec provides encryption on wired connections, ensuring data
     security on critical network links and protecting against unauthorized interception. Access Control
     Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The switch includes granular ACLs and RBAC for
     controlling access to network resources and restricting user actions based on roles, enhancing
     overall security. The switch provides Control Plane Policing (CoPP) and Dynamic ARP Inspection
     (DAI), which protect it from malicious attacks and prevent disruptions to network traffic.

  7. **Energy Efficiency and High Availability**: The switch includes front-to-back or back-to-front airflow
     options, along with redundant power supply support, enabling it to fit into a variety of data center
     cooling configurations. It also has hot-swappable fans and power supplies for minimal service
     interruption. Cisco EnergyWise: EnergyWise technology optimizes energy consumption, reducing the
     overall energy footprint and operational costs.

  8. **Quality of Service (QoS) and Application Prioritization**: The switch includes features like Weighted
     Random Early Detection (WRED) and priority flow control, allowing administrators to prioritize
     critical application traffic, ensure smooth performance for latency-sensitive applications, and
     reduce congestion. The switch supports eight egress queues per port, enabling granular traffic
     management for different classes of service, which helps ensure consistent performance for high-priority
     applications.

  9. **Spine-Leaf Architecture Compatibility**: The N9K-C93108TC-FX3P is well-suited for deployment as a
     leaf switch in a leaf-spine architecture, enabling easy scalability and predictable performance.
     It allows organizations to scale their network in a modular fashion by adding more leaf switches
     as required, without requiring changes in the spine layer.

  10. **Support for Cisco Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD)**: Cisco Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD)
      provides efficient traffic distribution across multiple servers, reducing the need for a dedicated
      load balancer and maximizing server utilization. ITD is particularly useful in clustered application
      environments, such as data analytics or web hosting, where traffic needs to be evenly distributed
      across multiple servers.

  11. **Flexible Management Options**: The switch offers multiple management interfaces, including the
