The Cisco Nexus N9K-C93180YC-FX (also known as the Nexus 93180YC-FX) is a high-performance, fixed-port
switch designed for modern data centers and enterprise networks that need high-speed, low-latency connectivity.
It’s part of Cisco’s Nexus 9000 series and is optimized for next-generation networking environments,
including those that use software-defined networking (SDN) and intent-based networking. Here are the
key features of the Cisco Nexus N9K-C93180YC-FX:

  1. **High-Speed 1/10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet Ports**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX is a 1RU switch that provides
     48 1/10/25-Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports and 6 40/100-GbE ports. It supports flexible configurations,
     with each 25-GbE port also able to operate at 10 Gbps, and the 40/100-GbE ports can be used for
     uplinks to connect to higher-speed switches or spine layers. This flexibility makes it suitable
     for a variety of network topologies, whether leaf-spine in data centers or as a high-speed aggregation
     switch in enterprise networks.

  2. **High-Performance and Low-Latency Architecture**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX delivers up to 3.6 Tbps of throughput
     and 1.2 Bpps of packet forwarding capacity, supporting environments with large amounts of data
     and low-latency requirements. It’s built on a high-performance ASIC that provides consistent low
     latency, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications like high-frequency trading, storage
     networking, and real-time analytics.

  3. **Programmability and Automation with NX-OS and ACI Mode**: The switch can operate in Cisco NX-OS mode
     for traditional network environments or in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode for SDN
     environments. In NX-OS mode, it provides advanced programmability with support for Python scripting,
     REST APIs, and other automation tools, making it easy to integrate into modern DevOps workflows.
     In ACI mode, it can be part of Cisco’s ACI framework, enabling centralized, policy-driven network
     management and simplifying the management of complex network architectures.

  4. **VXLAN Support for Network Virtualization**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX provides VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)
     support, allowing it to extend Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 infrastructure. VXLAN is essential
     for building scalable multi-tenant cloud environments, enabling virtualized networks, and supporting
     flexible network segmentation. It allows organizations to deploy virtual networks across multiple
     data centers, making it ideal for cloud environments and software-defined data centers.

  5. **Advanced Telemetry and Analytics**: Cisco has built advanced telemetry features into the N9K-C93180YC-FX,
     which can provide real-time insights into network traffic and health without impacting performance.
     It supports Streaming Telemetry, which sends detailed network data to monitoring platforms, helping
     administrators identify potential issues and optimize network performance proactively. The telemetry
     features can be used with Cisco’s Nexus Dashboard Insights or third-party analytics tools to gain
     deep visibility into the network.

  6. **Comprehensive Security Features**: The switch supports a range of security features, including MACsec
     (802.1AE), which provides data encryption on the wire for secure link-level communication. It also
     includes features like role-based access control (RBAC), Control Plane Policing (CoPP), and Dynamic
     ARP Inspection (DAI), which enhance the security and stability of the network. Security Group Access
     Control Lists (SGACLs) and IP Access Control Lists (IP ACLs) are also available to enforce granular
     security policies and protect the network from unauthorized access.

  7. **Scalability with Large MAC and Route Table Sizes**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX has a large MAC address table
     and forwarding table, supporting up to 256,000 entries, making it ideal for large-scale environments
     with many connected devices. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 routing capabilities, enabling it to handle
     complex network topologies and a large number of routes, which is beneficial in both enterprise
     and cloud data centers.

  8. **Flexible Buffering and Quality of Service (QoS)**: This switch includes dynamic buffer allocation,
     which allows for efficient packet queuing and prevents congestion during traffic spikes, especially
     useful for high-throughput applications. The advanced Quality of Service (QoS) features prioritize
     critical traffic, allowing administrators to allocate bandwidth based on application requirements,
     ensuring consistent performance for priority applications.

  9. **Cisco Intelligent Traffic Director (ITD)**: ITD is a load-balancing feature available on the N9K-C93180YC-FX
     that enables efficient traffic distribution across multiple servers without requiring a dedicated
     load balancer. It can support load balancing based on server utilization, maximizing resource efficiency
     and improving application availability. This feature is especially useful in scenarios where traffic
     needs to be distributed across a cluster of servers, such as in large-scale data analytics or web
     applications.

  10. **Integration with Cisco Tetration and Nexus Dashboard**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX is compatible with Cisco
      Tetration, which provides deep visibility, analytics, and security for data centers by monitoring
      and analyzing every packet in real-time. It also integrates with Cisco Nexus Dashboard, allowing
      for centralized management of Nexus switches and providing insights into application performance
      and network operations. These integrations help organizations gain comprehensive control over
      network security, compliance, and overall performance.

  11. **Flexible Cooling and Power Options**: The switch supports front-to-back or back-to-front airflow,
      allowing for deployment in various data center cooling configurations. The redundant, hot-swappable
      power supplies and fans ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime in case of hardware
      failure.

  12. **Layer 2 and Layer 3 Multicast Support**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX includes extensive support for Layer 2
      and Layer 3 multicast, allowing for efficient distribution of data across multiple hosts, which
      is valuable in applications like media streaming and real-time data sharing. It supports protocols
      like PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast), IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), and MLD
      (Multicast Listener Discovery) to provide robust multicast capabilities.

  13. **Easy Scalability in Leaf-Spine Architecture**: The N9K-C93180YC-FX is well-suited for leaf-spine
      architectures, which provide scalable and predictable performance by minimizing the number of
      hops between devices. It’s an ideal choice for organizations looking to deploy modular and scalable
      network topologies in modern data centers, with support for rapid expansion as data center demands
      grow.
